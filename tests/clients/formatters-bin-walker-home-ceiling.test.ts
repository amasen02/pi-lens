/**
 * #2514: `findInNodeModules`'s ancestor walk (`clients/formatters.ts`) had no
 * HOME ceiling, so a stray `~/node_modules/.bin/oxfmt.cmd` (the home-level
 * pi-extensions manifest installs its own bins) was picked up as the
 * project's formatter on any box with a home-level `node_modules`. The same
 * unceilinged shape existed in `findInVendorBin` (`vendor/bin`) and
 * `findInVenv` (`.venv`/`venv`).
 *
 * #2544 review F2 folded all three onto the single shared walker,
 * `findLocalBinUpwards` (`clients/package-manager.ts`, also behind stylua,
 * taplo, knip, jscpd and madge): the ONLY thing that differs per ecosystem is
 * the `binDirs`/`windowsExt` options each `formatters.ts` delegation passes.
 * These cases therefore drive `findLocalBinUpwards` directly with exactly
 * those option sets — the ceiling has one implementation to test. That the
 * delegations pass the RIGHT options is covered through the production
 * `resolveCommand` seam by `formatters.test.ts` ("resolveCommand — .venv",
 * "resolveCommand — vendor/bin") and `formatter-unavailable-outcome.test.ts`.
 *
 * Per #2517's per-walker policy: these are TOOL-RESOLUTION walkers, not
 * config-file lookups — escaping the project upward past HOME must mean
 * STOP, not keep reading. A `node_modules/.bin`/`vendor/bin`/`.venv` match
 * found at or above HOME can never be the project's own installed dependency.
 *
 * Every case here pins a FAKE `homeDir` explicitly (never the real
 * `os.homedir()`) so the test is hermetic regardless of what the running
 * box's actual home directory contains (probe hygiene: never plant fixtures
 * under the maintainer's real `$HOME`).

/**
 * Re-spell a directory path: same characters, different case, and (on win32)
 * the other separator form.
 *
 * On win32 the re-cased part is the DRIVE LETTER — `C:\…` → `c:\…`, the exact
 * form VS Code URIs produce and the form the maintainer's real `latency.log`
 * carries — and `path.relative` folds it, so the re-spelling names the SAME
 * directory. On POSIX there is no drive letter and paths are case-SENSITIVE,
 * so re-casing the last segment names a DIFFERENT directory. Both behaviours
 * are load-bearing, so the cases below branch on the platform rather than
 * skipping: over-folding on POSIX would be as much a bug as under-folding on
 * win32.
 *
 * The separator flip on win32 also satisfies the repo's cross-form path rule
 * (record one separator, check the other) — it replaces the round-1 case that
 * was byte-identical to the plain ceiling case on every platform (#2544 F3).
